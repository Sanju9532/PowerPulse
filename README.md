PowerPulse-Household-Energy-Usage-Forecast


The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict household energy consumption based on
historical data. Using this model, consumers can gain insights into their usage patterns, while energy providers can
forecast demand more effectively.

Overview:
      PowerPulse is a machine learning-based model designed to predict household energy usage. By analyzing past energy 
consumption data, the model provides accurate forecasts to help users optimize energy consumption and promote sustainability. 
The project employs Linear Regression, Random Forests, and Neural Networks to achieve high accuracy, with an R² score of 0.99946.

Project Features:
      *Energy usage prediction: Forecast future household energy usage based on historical data.
      *Model comparison: Utilizes and compares three machine learning models—Linear Regression,Decision Tree, Random Forests and Gradient Boosting.
      *High accuracy: Achieved an R² score of 0.99946 on the validation set.

Models Used:
       *Linear Regression: A basic, interpretable model that assumes a linear relationship between features and the target variable.
       *Random Forests: An ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve predictive performance and handle overfitting. 
       *Gradient Boosting:An ensemble learning technique that builds models sequentially, where each new model corrects the errors of the previous ones,
                         enhancing predictive accuracy and robustness against overfitting.
